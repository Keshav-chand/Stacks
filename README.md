The stack program is a simple implementation of a stack data structure in Java. It allows users to create a stack of integers with a specified size and perform various operations such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements from the stack, and printing the elements of the stack.

Constructor: The stack constructor initializes a stack of integers with a specified size. It also initializes the stack pointer (cpointer) to -1, indicating an empty stack.

Push Operation: The push method allows users to push elements onto the stack. It checks for stack overflow condition and returns false if the stack is full. Otherwise, it adds the element to the stack and returns true.

Pop Operation: The pop method allows users to pop elements from the stack. It checks for stack underflow condition and returns 0 if the stack is empty. Otherwise, it removes and returns the top element of the stack.
